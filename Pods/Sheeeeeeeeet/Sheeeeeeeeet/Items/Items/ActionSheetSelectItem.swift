 Select items are used to let the user select one or several
 items in an action sheet. Unlike the `ActionSheetItem` type,
 this type has an `isSelected` state, a selected icon and an
 extended appearance.
 
 This item type is not meant to be used directly. However, a
 `selectItem` appearance property is still available, if you
 want to style single and multiselect items the same way.
 
 Instead of this type, you should use any of its subclasses:
 
 * `ActionSheetSingleSelectItem` should be used whenever the
 user should only be able to select a single item in a sheet.
 Single select items automatically deselect all other single
 select items in the same group when tapped, which means you
 can use many groups in the same sheet. A single select item
 by default dismisses the action sheet when it is tapped. To
 change this behavior, set `tapBehavior` to `.none`.
 
 * `ActionSheetMultiSelectItem` should be used when the user
 should be able to select one or several items in a sheet. A
 multiselect item will not affect any other select items. It
 can also be used with an `ActionSheetMultiSelectToggleItem`,
 which can automatically toggle the selection state of every
 multiselect item in the same group. A multiselect item does
 not dismiss the sheet, since the user will most probably be
 in a context, where any changes made in the sheet should be
 applied with an OK button. See the example app.
